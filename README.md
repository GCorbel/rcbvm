## What is this project

This project is just a simple website about the RCBVM (Regroupement Citoyen de la Base de Vill√©giature de Moisie). This is not very interesting for developpers.

## Why it could be intersant for a developper?

In this project, I integrated a front-end editor to Refinery CMS. I use aloha-editor for the wysiwyg but I think it's easy to change it. It's also easy to use it with a standard Rails application or other gems or CMS.

This project use the gem frontendeditor_ckeditor
