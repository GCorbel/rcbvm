## What is this project

This project is just a simple website about the RCBVM (Regroupement Citoyen de la Base de Vill√©giature de Moisie). This is not very interesting for developpers.

## Why it could be intersant for a developper?

In this project, I integreted a front-end editor to RefineryCMS. I use aloha-editor for the wysiwyg but I think it's easy to change it. It's also easy to use it with a standard rails application or other gems or CMS.

## What is this branch

This is the same think than master branch but for ckeditor. For more details please see the README in the master branch.

I made another screencast, for CKeditor, [here]
